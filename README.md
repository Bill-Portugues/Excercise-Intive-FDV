# Excercise-Intive-FDV

My sequence of steps to develop any piece of code usually starts the same way:

First I get some white board or piece of paper and I began to sketch some first thoughts. Trying to engage the main challenges of the assignment, How big should it be ? Where to start? How many objects, classes, etc should I create? Can I break it into smaller and simple pieces and then integrate all of them ? How could they interact between them? This step frequently arrives at a primitive, very brute idea of how to implement it with a lot of cross out sections.

Second I start coding, initializing by those parts of the problem that I have a much more clear sense of how they are going to be. In this section, while writing it, a lot of possible future bugs are avoided by refining a lot that initial idea within the paper. I tend to implement small functions and classes, testing them and then moving to other sections of the problem, leaving already test it modules for the future integration.

Third and last step, once I had all the separate ingredients for the model Iâ€™m building I bring all of them together in the right order, sometimes polishing some interactive problems between the different units and then start a battery of tests to check if the program do as it was supposed to. 



In this particular exercise I spend some time trying to think the best possible way to interact between different types of Rentals and their periodic time differences.
